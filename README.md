# About Me

I’m a software developer who works primarily in C#, .NET, Angular, and TypeScript/JavaScript. I use Linux Mint as my main operating system and keep Windows 11 virtualized in VirtualBox when needed. I rely heavily on AI tools to assist with prototyping, debugging, and design, but I approach their output critically—always testing assumptions and verifying results.

My work often involves building practical solutions using Azure services, including Azure AI, Key Vault, Blob Storage, and Microsoft Graph API. One of my active projects is a voice-enabled assistant (VOICE.UI) that combines speech-to-text, GPT-driven conversation, and text-to-speech—all built into a modular architecture.

I tinker with Raspberry Pi systems and older hardware, using them for things like resource monitoring displays, self-hosted tools, and backup systems. I favor simplicity in my builds and processes, preferring configuration files over environment variables and avoiding unnecessary abstraction. My hardware setups are deliberately functional—open-air, no RGB lighting, and inspired more by car design than gamer aesthetics.

I don’t claim deep expertise. I consider myself a persistent experimenter who knows how to ask the right questions and work toward useful solutions, even when the path isn’t clear at the start.

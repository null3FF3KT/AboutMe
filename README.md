# About Me — Clinton Billedeaux  

👋 **Overview**  
Full Stack Developer focused on **.NET**, **Azure**, and **Angular**. I build systems that make complex operations simpler and more reliable.  
My background spans **finance**, **government**, and **SaaS**, with experience designing secure cloud applications, data integrations, and process automation.  

I also work with applied AI tools when they improve accuracy or reduce friction—but always as part of the engineering toolkit, not the centerpiece.  
The goal is straightforward: build software that works, lasts, and earns trust.
